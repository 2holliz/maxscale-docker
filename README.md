Sharded Database with MaxScale and Docker
Project Overview
This project sets up a sharded MariaDB database system using Docker Compose and MariaDB MaxScale as a database proxy/router. It demonstrates basic database sharding by distributing data across two separate master databases (shards) and routing queries to them through MaxScale.
A Python script is provided to connect to the MaxScale instance and perform queries to retrieve and display specific information from the sharded databases.

Components
docker-compose.yml
•	Deploys two MariaDB master containers (master, master2)
•	Deploys one MaxScale container
•	Mounts config files and exposes ports
MaxScale Configuration (maxscale.cnf.d/example.cnf)
•	Defines two database servers: zip_master_one and zip_master_two
•	Configures a schemarouter service (Sharded-Service) to route queries based on database names to the correct shard
•	Includes a monitor to keep track of both servers’ availability
Python Script (query_script.py)
•	Connects to MaxScale on port 4000
•	Runs four queries:
1.	Largest zipcode in zipcodes_one
2.	All zipcodes where state is KY
3.	All zipcodes between 40000 and 41000
4.	TotalWages where state is PA from zipcodes_two
•	Displays query results in the console
________________________________________
How to Run
1.	Clone the repo (or download project files)
2.	Build and run the containers
 	docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
3.	Check MaxScale server status
 	docker-compose exec maxscale maxctrl list servers
4.	Run the Python query script
 	python3 query_script.py

Expected Output
Example console output:
Largest zipcode in zipcodes_one:
('99999',)

All zipcodes where State='KY':
('40003',)
('40004',)

All zipcodes between 40000 and 41000:
('40001',)
('40002',)

TotalWages where State='PA':
(45000,)
(52000,)
